# Trading Agent
Models for quantitative trading (including backtest tools and real time agents) using python.

- Libs necessary:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - yfinance
- It is worth mentioning that I am using pandas to achieve this purpose. So, in the future, if any one desires to use these tools, use pandas.

- To run this script:

```
$ python3 main.py
```
